The "lndir" program in this directory is required only to run the test
suites.  It is not part of the CSSC suite as installed.

None of the programs in this directory will be installed as part of
the CSSC package; many of them are used only by the test suites.  Some
of them are not even used by the test suite.  "last-time.c", for
example, is provided to help you figure out when your C library's
time(2) function gives out.  Mine (GNU glibc, currently at version
2.0.7, over Linux 2.0.31 running on an Intel 486) gives out at Tue Jan
19 03:14:07 2038 (UTC).
