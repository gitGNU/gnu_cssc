This file lists those files which are part of the CSSC distribution
but which are copied from elsewhere (and may need to be updated to
track the originals).  Filenames are relative to the top level source
directory.


COPYING		   GPL version 3
install-sh	   From the autoconf distribution
missing		   From the automake distribution
mkinstalldirs      From the automake distribution
docs/texinfo.tex   From the automake distribution
googletest/*	   See googletest/README.cssc
bootstrap	   From the coreutils distribution

The following files are either forked from their original
counterparts, or I can't find/recall the original source or version:-


testutils/lndir.c     X11R6 (Modified for use with Automake rather than xmkmf)
testutils/lndir.man   X11R6 (Accompanies lndir.c but is unmodified)
bsd/*		      From one of the *BSD FTP sites (version??)
docs/gpl.texi	      Texinfo version of GPL version 2 (source unknown!)
ekko.c		      From GNU shellutils (local changes to use config.h)
