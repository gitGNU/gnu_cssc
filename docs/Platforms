[*] These entries denote that CSSC compiled successfully but the test
suite was not run.




Because GNU CSSC uses GNU "autoconf" to generate configuration
scripts, it's reasonable to expect CSSC to work on almost any version
of Unix with little or no modification.  If modification is required,
it is best to modify "configure.in" appropriately and let "configure"
determine what needs to be done.  However, if you do not have GNU
Autoconf installed you will not be able to regenerate "configure" from
"configure.in".  In any case, please let the maintainer know about
these required modifications (see the README file in the distribution
directory).  Don't forget also to explain clearly *why* these
modifications are required, and on what systems.

If you wish to install GNU Autoconf, you can obtain it from the GNU
Project's FTP site, ftp.gnu.org.  You will probably also find GNU
Automake useful.

CSSC has not, as far as I know, been widely tested with C++ compilers
other than GCC:-

GCC (2.7,2.8,EGCS)		Compiles, test suite passes
EPC C++                         Compiles, test suite passes
IRIX CC				Fails to compile (see below)


Notes for specific platforms
============================

HPUX
----
To compile on HPUX 9 you have to use GNU make and /bin/posix/sh:
$ SHELL=/bin/posix/sh $SHELL ./configure
$ gmake SHELL=/bin/posix/sh 


IRIX
----
To compile on IRIX it appears that GNU make is required.  CSSC also
does not compile with IRIX's native cc, "CC".  The IRIX compiler seems
not to support static template instantiation.  (Thanks to Achim
Hoffmann <hoffmann@tebis.de> for this information).


Ultrix 4.2
----------
Mark Reynolds has run the test suite on this platform (at CSSC version
0.11 alpha.pl2).  All the tests except one pass.  In the failing test,
we get a coredump:-

> All tests pass, except that anything involving get -r ANYTHING -p
> ... or get -r ANYTHING -s core dump. Again, when I have isolated the
> problem I will send a more detailed report along with (hopefully)
> patches.

To run the tests on this platform, one must use:-

> Because this OS is so ancient, it is not possible to run "make
> check" out of the box. Both "sh" and "sh5" (the Sys V version of sh)
> give syntax errors loading the defs in common. However "make
> SHELL=bash check" does run (I'm using bash 2.03).  


NetBSD
------

The Texinfo feature @env{} is not supported by version 1.68 of
Makeinfo which comes with some versoins of NetBSD.  To work around
this problem, you could apply the following sed command to
"cssc.texi":-

	sed -e 's/@env{\([^]]*\)}/@code{\1}/'


GNU libc
--------

GNU libc 2.2.3 has a bug in it which means that if you use GCC 2.97 or
later, classes cannot have member functions called "printf".  The
configure script works around this problem (by turning off
optimisation).  The glibc bug is fixed in glibc 2.2.4.  CSSC compiles
successfully under GCC version 3.01, with this workaround in place. 


Windows NT
----------

CSSC compiles under the CYGWIN environment for Windows NT.  CSSC
support inder the Cygwin environment is nearly up to the standard of
Unix implementations, but there are three significant areas in which
it falls short :-

1. Files are often created with the wrong mode, but for the most part
   the relevant program changes the mode of the output file to the
   correct value immediately after closing the file. 

2. The "Atomic" NFS locking support (which is done on Unix with the use
   of link(2) requires the ability to use link(2) on an open file; this 
   is a feature which is not supported under the Cygwin environment.
   For this reason, it is unsafe to use the Cygwin version of CSSC on
   SCCS files which are mounted via an NT NFS client.  If, on the other hand,
   the files are mounted via Samba, this shoul dbe safe (but has not been 
   tested).

3. Set-user-id execution will not work properly.  Because of the
   insecure nature of the current code base, this mode of operation 
   is not currently supported anyway, but this is liable to be
   especially poor under Windows NT due to the significant differences in
   the security models of Unix and Windows NT.  The Cygwin environment
   does provide tools for resolving this problem, but this has not been done. 

A small number of the test cases for the "sccs.exe" binary fail under
CYGWIN; this is because, although they do the right thing, the output
messages are in the wrong order.  The reason behind this is that under
Unix when you use "sccs unedit" the output of "get" appears before the
output of the "unget()" function, even though the unget() happens
first.  This is because the output of the unget() function is buffered
and hence is only flushed to the output file when the parent process
exits.  The stdio buffering arrangements for CYGWIN seem to be
slightly different, and this changes the ordering.  For this reason,
test "h1" currently fails, and is skipped for CYGWIN.
