If you are kind enough to submit patches, first of all, thanks.   If
you do, please _please_ send git patches made against a recent version
of the tree.  See <http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=cssc>.

When submitting diffs, please indicate what they are for (that is,
please indicate the nature of the bug they fix or the system and
version which requires the change).

You can submit patches by email to bug-cssc@gnu.org.  However, if they
are large, we may need you to assign copyright in those changes to the
Free Software Foundation before applying them.
