There is a mailing list for users of GNU CSSC; it's principally
devoted to the development of the program.   If you have a bug report
to make or a question about GNU CSSC, it may be better to send it to
the CSSC maintainer (see the CSSC manual).   

If you wish to join this mailing list, please visit its web site at
http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/cssc-users.  

If you don't want to subscribe via the web interface, you could send
an email to <cssc-users-request@gnu.org>.  The body of this message
should contain just the word "subscribe".

Please do not send email to the list without joining it first.
