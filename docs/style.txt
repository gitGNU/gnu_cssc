Notes on the coding style used in the maintenance of CSSC
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Indentation.

	The indentation used by the code may look random to you, but
	it is quite simple, really.  MySC, the package on which CSSC
	is based, was written with a K&R indentation style.  New code
	written for CSSC, or rewritten code, is indented according to
	the GNU style (that is, with Emacs's default indentation
	rules).  This is deliberate; please don't re-indent code
	UNLESS you are rewriting it.  New code for CSSC should be
	indented in the GNU fashion.


2. Design.

        Much of the design of CSSC is inherited from MySC.  MySC was
	written when the C++ language was quite different to the way
	it is now, and when GCC was a much less good C++ compiler.
	Hence it has features which now seem non-optimal.  While
	redesigning CSSC to be more elegant might be nice, it is far
	more important to make it work *correctly*.  Redesign has been
	deliberately avoided unless it can be done in the course of
	other work required for the sake of correctness.


3. Comments

	Yes, please.  But no "//" comments in the C code, though
	they're fine for the C++ code.


4. Other aspects of the coding style.

	 Most of the other aspects of the coding for this project
	 follow the GNU guidelines.   The only exception is the
	 function call notation; while the GNU standard stipulates
	 "f ()", I strongly prefer "f()".  If there is actually a
	 reason to eschew one in favour of the other, please let me
	 know.
