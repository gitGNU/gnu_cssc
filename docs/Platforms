Porting People
--------------
The following people have helped ensure that CSSC has worked on
these platforms (at some stage):

James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>    		    Red Hat Linux, version
						    4.1, 4.2, 5.0.
James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>    		[!] HPUX 9
Lars Hecking    <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>              Solaris-2.5.1
Malcolm Boff    <Malcolm_Boff@compuserve.com>       Solaris-2.5.1
Lars Hecking    <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>              IRIX 6.3 (GCC 2.7.x
						    configured for IRIX 5.3)
Lars Hecking    <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>              IRIX 6.3 (GCC 2.8.0)
Richard Polton  <rap@maths.soton.ac.uk>		    IRIX 5.3
Dave Bodenstab  <imdave@mcs.net>		    FreeBSD-2.0.5-950622-SNAP
Andy Sharp      <andy@accrue.com>		    FreeBSD-2.2.2-RELEASE
Lars Hecking	<lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>		[*] SunOS 4
Lars Hecking	<lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>		[*] AmigaOS (ixemul)
Andrew Bardsley <bardslea@cs.man.ac.uk>		[*] GNU Hurd

[*] These entries denote that CSSC compiled successfully but the test
suite was not run.

[!] To compile on HPUX 9 you have to use GNU make and /bin/posix/sh:
$ SHELL=/bin/posix/sh $SHELL ./configure
$ gmake SHELL=/bin/posix/sh 


Because GNU CSSC uses GNU "autoconf" to generate configuration
scripts, it's reasonable to expect CSSC to work on almost any version
of Unix with little or no modification.  If modification is required,
it is best to modify "configure.in" appropriately and let "configure"
determine what needs to be done.  However, if you do not have GNU
Autoconf installed you will not be able to regenerate "configure" from
"configure.in".  In any case, please let the maintainer know about
these required modifications (see the README file in the distribution
directory).  Don't forget also to explain clearly *why* these
modifications are required, and on what systems.

If you wish to install GNU Autoconf, you can obtain it from the GNU
Project's FTP site, ftp.gnu.org.  You will probably also find GNU
Automake useful.

As far as I know however, CSSC has not yet been tested with any C++
compiler other than GCC, so I *do* expect portability problems there.
