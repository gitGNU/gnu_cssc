Porting People
--------------
The following people have helped ensure that CSSC has worked on
these platforms (at some stage):

James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>    		    Red Hat Linux, versions
						    4.1,4.2,5.0,5.1,5.2,5.9,
						    6.0, 6.2, 7.0, 7.1
James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>    		    HPUX 9
Lars Hecking    <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>              Solaris-2.5.1
Malcolm Boff    <Malcolm_Boff@compuserve.com>       Solaris-2.5.1
Lars Hecking    <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>              IRIX 6.3 (GCC 2.7.x
						    configured for IRIX 5.3)
Lars Hecking    <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>              IRIX 6.3 (GCC 2.8.0)
Richard Polton  <rap@maths.soton.ac.uk>		    IRIX 5.3

Lars Hecking	<lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>		[*] SunOS 4
Mark Reynolds   <mark@aoainc.com>                   SunOS 4.1.3
Lars Hecking	<lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>		[*] AmigaOS (ixemul)
Andrew Bardsley <bardslea@cs.man.ac.uk>		[*] GNU Hurd
James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>    		    Dynix/ptx 4.2

Mark Reynolds   <mark@aoainc.com>                   Ultrix 4.2  [SEE BELOW!]

[*] These entries denote that CSSC compiled successfully but the test
suite was not run.




Because GNU CSSC uses GNU "autoconf" to generate configuration
scripts, it's reasonable to expect CSSC to work on almost any version
of Unix with little or no modification.  If modification is required,
it is best to modify "configure.in" appropriately and let "configure"
determine what needs to be done.  However, if you do not have GNU
Autoconf installed you will not be able to regenerate "configure" from
"configure.in".  In any case, please let the maintainer know about
these required modifications (see the README file in the distribution
directory).  Don't forget also to explain clearly *why* these
modifications are required, and on what systems.

If you wish to install GNU Autoconf, you can obtain it from the GNU
Project's FTP site, ftp.gnu.org.  You will probably also find GNU
Automake useful.

CSSC has not, as far as I know, been widely tested with C++ compilers
other than GCC:-

GCC (2.7,2.8,EGCS)		Compiles, test suite passes
EPC C++                         Compiles, test suite passes
IRIX CC				Fails to compile (see below)


Notes for specific platforms
============================

HPUX
----
To compile on HPUX 9 you have to use GNU make and /bin/posix/sh:
$ SHELL=/bin/posix/sh $SHELL ./configure
$ gmake SHELL=/bin/posix/sh 


IRIX
----
To compile on IRIX it appears that GNU make is required.  CSSC also
does not compile with IRIX's native cc, "CC".  The IRIX compiler seems
not to support static template instantiation.  (Thanks to Achim
Hoffmann <hoffmann@tebis.de> for this information).


Ultrix 4.2
----------
Mark Reynolds has run the test suite on this platform (at CSSC version
0.11 alpha.pl2).  All the tests except one pass.  In the failing test,
we get a coredump:-

> All tests pass, except that anything involving get -r ANYTHING -p
> ... or get -r ANYTHING -s core dump. Again, when I have isolated the
> problem I will send a more detailed report along with (hopefully)
> patches.

To run the tests on this platform, one must use:-

> Because this OS is so ancient, it is not possible to run "make
> check" out of the box. Both "sh" and "sh5" (the Sys V version of sh)
> give syntax errors loading the defs in common. However "make
> SHELL=bash check" does run (I'm using bash 2.03).
