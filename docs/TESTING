Brief instructions on testing.

To run the tests, do
        make check
but if you are modifying code, you can re-run any failing tests by
using one of the specific tests listed in the makefile.

The test suite is the single most important component of CSSC.  It
ensures that CSSC faithfully emulates SCCS, misfeatures and all.  It
also provides for regression testing as an integral part of each
bug-fix and release.  There has so far been a linear relationship
between test-cases written and the number of bugs or missing features
found.  This means that the fastest way to improve CSSC is not to hack
with the code, but to write new test cases.  If, as the worst case, a
new test case does not reveal a new bug, it might prevent one in the
future.  This means that ALL new test cases are useful.

The following people have improved the quality of CSSC by providing
cases for the test suite:
