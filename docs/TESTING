Brief instructions on testing.

Running the tests currently requires:-

1.	A Posix-like /bin/sh
		Specifically the sourcing command (".") is required.
		GNU Bash, for example, is fine.

2.	lndir
		Lndir is a utility from the X11 distribution for
		making a duplicate of a directory tree using "ln".  In
		the future, configure will work around a missing
		"lndir".  Currently, it is required.

To run the tests, first enter the direcotory "tests".  Testing is
driven via "make".  The programs in the suite can be tested
unduvudually or make can be used to run all the tests.  Normally,
after compiling CSSC you would want to run all the tests and this is
done with
	make all-tests
but if you are modifying code, you can re-run any failing tests by
using one of the specific tests listed in the makefile.


The test suite is the single most important component of CSSC.  It
ensures that CSSC failthfully emulates SCCS, misfeatures and all.  It
also provides for regression testing as an integral part of each
bug-fix and release.  There has so far been a linear relationship
between test-cases written and bugs or missing features found.  This
means that the fastest way to improve CSSC is not to hack with the
code, but to write new test cases.  If, as the worst case, a new test
case does not reveal a new bug, it might prevent one in the future.
This means that ALL new test cases are useful.

The following people have improved the quality of CSSC by providing
cases for the test suite:
