This directory contains rudimentary tests for the CSSC package.

$(srcdir)/tests/Makefile is created in the compilation directory but
basically the tests only work when run from the test directory below
the source directory.   This should be improved.

However for the tests themselves the environment variable "dir"
selects where the programs to be tested are found, so if your 
machine has "genuine" SCCS in (say) /usr/sccs, you can say
export dir=/usr/sccs and run these tests on the genuine article.

Most of these tests contain no checks of the contents of stderr.   
Output to stdout is checked, as are return values.   However, CSSC
produces more warning messages than genuine SCCS and also these
messages are in a different (more helpful?) format.
