This file points out features of SCCS that are missing from CSSC, by
accident or design, but are not currently listed in the TODO file.
The reason they're not listed in the TODO file is generally either
that they involve a lot of work or that I don't think they're
important.


sccs-help is not implemented.
Binary files are not handled (support for ^A f e 0 -- files with the
encoded flag whose value is 0, is present).
