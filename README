This is the README file for GNU CSSC, a workalike for the source code
control system SCCS.  It is based on the MySC package by Ross Ridge.

CSSC is currently under development so expect problems with compiling
the package on older machines and perhaps even incorrect operation.
For a list of known bugs see docs/BUGS.  For a list of now-fixed bugs
see docs/FIXED.
==============================================================================
			Quick Start
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Compiling
 mkdir work
 cd work
 ../configure
 make

2.	Testing 
 if make check 2>&1 | tee make.log 
 then
	uname -a | mail -s "CSSC success" jay@gnu.org
 else
	echo FAILED, please send full details to 'jay@gnu.org.'
	(uname -a ; cat make.log) | mail -s "CSSC failure" jay@gnu.org 
 fi


 If the tests failed, I'll definitely need some more information and
 so it would be best to keep the test outputs in case I need them in
 order to fix the bug ("tar cf failed-tests.tar tests" should do fine
 for that).  I may need to ask you to send a compressed version of
 this to me.


3.	Installing
 cd work
 make install

==============================================================================

SCCS commands implemented this package are: admin, cdc, delta, get,
prs, prt, sccsdiff, rmdel, sact, unget and what.  Not all options and
capabilities of the commands have been implemented yet, and the comb,
val and vc commands are not provided at all.  Features soon to be
provided but not yet available are the BSD sccs-driver command "sccs",
and a Bourne shell script for converting SCCS files to RCS files (a
csh script exists for this purpose [sccs2rcs.csh] but not everybody
has csh).

Unimplemented features include consistency checking (admin -h),
ignored deltas (delta -g), printing the differences after a delta
(delta -p), l-files (get -l), and getting a delta by sequence number
(get -a).  Some features like including and excluding deltas (get -i
-x) have been implemented but not extensively tested.

See the file INSTALL for information on how to compile this package.
Send any questions or bug reports by e-mail to the current maintainer,
<jay@gnu.org>.  After you have compiled CSSC, _PLEASE_ run the test
suite, as described in docs/TESTING.

To generate the manual, type "make dvi".  For the PostScript version,
type "cd docs ; make cssc.ps".  If you don't have TeX, you can read
the "info" documentation with either the GNU "info" program, or Emacs.



The most helpful thing you could possibly do for this project would be
to contribute a new test case.  It isn't hard; the test scripts are
just shell scripts; instructions on how to do this are provided in the
manual.
