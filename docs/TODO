	* Check the interaction between any -r option to get and the
	release floors and ceilings.

	* Use standard string class rather than mystring?

	* sccsfile.h: get, delta and sccs-diff must use the "encoding" flag.

	* sf-admin.cc: Test setting & removing the 'e' flag.

	* Write a shell script for converting SCCS files to RCS files; use
	the Bourne shell, since not everybody has the C shell [suggested
	by RMS].

	* Consider using the BSD sccs(1) code.

	* sccs-val is not yet provided.   Useful for testing.

	* When the Makefile is updated using configure, under control of
 	make, the CXXFLAGS macro grows to contain multiple copies of
 	$(CXXFLAGS), presumably because it is exported to configure by
 	make.  Refer to some other autoconf-using program to see how this
 	stuff should be done.
