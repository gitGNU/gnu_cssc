The MySC package provides the bulk of the functionality of this
package, compiled under GCC 2.4.5, and was written by Ross Ridge.

This package was updated for modern C++ compilers, fixed, enhanced,
and sparingly documented by James Youngman, <JYoungman@vggas.com>.

Lars Hecking <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie> provided valuable help with
Autoconf and portability information for Solaris, SunOS, AmigaOS, and
IRIX.  Plus, lots and *lots* of testing and useful bug reports.
