Porting People
--------------
The following people have helped ensure that CSSC has worked on
these platforms (at some stage):

James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>    		    Red Hat Linux, version
						    4.1, 4.2, 5.0.
James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>    		[!] HPUX 9
Lars Hecking    <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>              Solaris-2.5.1
Malcolm Boff    <Malcolm_Boff@compuserve.com>       Solaris-2.5.1
Lars Hecking    <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>              IRIX 6.3 (GCC 2.7.x
						    configured for IRIX 5.3)
Lars Hecking    <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>              IRIX 6.3 (GCC 2.8.0)
Richard Polton  <rap@maths.soton.ac.uk>		    IRIX 5.3
Dave Bodenstab  <imdave@mcs.net>		    FreeBSD-2.0.5-950622-SNAP
Andy Sharp      <andy@accrue.com>		    FreeBSD-2.2.2-RELEASE
Lars Hecking	<lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>		[*] SunOS 4
Lars Hecking	<lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>		[*] AmigaOS (ixemul)
Andrew Bardsley <bardslea@cs.man.ac.uk>		[*] GNU Hurd

[*] These entries denote that CSSC compiled successfully but the test
suite was not run.

[!] To compile on HPUX 9 you have to use GNU make and /bin/posix/sh:
$ SHELL=/bin/posix/sh $SHELL ./configure
$ gmake SHELL=/bin/posix/sh 


Because GNU CSSC uses GNU "autoconf" to generate configuration
scripts, it's reasonable to expect CSSC to work on almost any version
of Unix with little or no modification.  As far as I know however, it
has not yet been tested with any C++ compiler other than GCC, so I
*do* expect portability problems there.
