There is a mailing list for users of GNU CSSC; it's principally
devoted to the development of the program.   If you have a bug report
to make or a question about GNU CSSC, it may be better to send it to
the CSSC maintainer (see the CSSC manual).   

If you wish to join this mailing list, please send an email to
<cssc-users-request@gnu.org>, with the subject "subscribe
cssc-users".  In the body of the message you should indicate your full
name and the email address under which you would like to subscribe.
Please send the subscription address from the same email address.   If
you do not get a response within a few days, this is probably because
your email address is wrong.

Please do not send email to the list without joining it first.
