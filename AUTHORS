CSSC was written and is maintained by James Youngman <jay@gnu.org>.

CSSC was based upon an earlier package, MySC, by Ross Ridge.

The "sccs" program and its accompanying documentation were written by
Eric Allman, and are copyright (C) 1980, 1993 The Regents of the
University of California.  See the file ``bsd/COPYING.bsd'' for more
information.

See also the file docs/CREDITS for alist of other contributors without
whose input CSSC would be much less useful than it is today.  I'd like
to take this opportuniity to thank them.
