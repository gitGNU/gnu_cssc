2008-01-06  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* sf-delta.cc (add_delta): Removed obsolete "XXX" comments.
	* sf-prs.cc (get): Likewise.
	* cdc.cc (main): Avoid initialising a sid object by assignment
	from NULL, because it's not quite clear what that is intended to
	do.  Instead, use an assignment from sid::null_delta().
	* sid.cc (null_sid): Implement the function.

	code coverage.
	* mystring.cc: Removed TODO comments which actually don't need to
	be done.

	* sf-admin.cc (admin): If all releases are locked ("admin -fla")
	and the user tries to unlock just one release, issue an error
	message (instead of just ignoring the attempt).
	* docs/cssc.texi (admin): Explain the (already existing)
	restriction and how to get around it.

	Implement "get -l", "get -L" and "get -lp".
	* get.cc (main): Added options -l and -L for get.
	(main): Print the name of the s-file before the delta summary (for
	-l) and the gotten body (for -p).
	* tests/get/delta-summary.sh: New tests for the -L, -l and -lp
	options of get.
	* sccsname.h (class sccs_name): new method lfile(), returning the
	name of the l-file.
	* sccsname.cc (sccs_name::lfile): Implement it.
	* sccsfile.h (sccs_file::get): Take a parameter summary_file,
	being a FILE* pointer to which we should emit a delta summary if
	it's not NULL.
	* sf-get2.cc (sccs_file::get): Add the new summary_file parameter
	and, if it's not NULL, emit a delta summary.

	diffing the unpacked tar archives.  

2007-12-19  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* what.cc: String constants chould be const.

	* sf-val.cc (validate_substituted_flags_list): Added missing
	return statement.

	* sccsfile.cc (sccs_file): Specify the member initialisers in the
	order they will actually be executed.

	* linebuf.h (class cssc_linebuf): Make buflen size_t rather than
	int.

	* linebuf.cc (CONFIG_LINEBUF_CHUNK_SIZE): Avoid signed/unsigned
	issues by using an unsigned constant.
	(read_line): Ditto for constants in this function.

	(gstrncat): Ditto for parameter 'length'.
	(gstrcpy): Ditto for parameter 'length'.

	* bsd/sccs.c (FBUFSIZ): Make unsigned.

	Update license to GPL version 3.
	* NEWS: Mention this change.
	* docs/cssc.texi (Copying): Put the GPL in a separate, unnumbered,
	section. 

	* docs/cssc.texi: Change license to version 1.2 of the GNU Free
	Documentation License.
	* docs/Makefile.am (cssc_TEXINFOS): Depend on fdl.texi, so that it
	gets distributed. 
	* NEWS: Mention this change.

	* docs/Makefile.am (cssc_TEXINFOS): Don't depend on
	config-info.text, since we don't actually use it.  This prevents
	us trying to rebuild the info file during "make distcheck", when
	the source directory is read-only anyway.
	* doc/texinfo.tex: Update to the version of texinfo.tex used in
	automake-1.8.  Yo avoid future compatibility issues, it makes
	sense to remove this file from CVS in fact, but we won't do that
	just yet. 

	* tests/bsd-sccs/delsfile.sh (cleanup): Also clean up ./s.foo when
	we're finished.

	Fix build problems caused by the fact that generating
	testutils/Makefile in the top level directory produces
	a Makefile that expects to use config.h, while we actually 
	want to use DEFS in the testutils subdirectory.
	* configure.ac: Call AC_OUTPUT only once.  Do not emit
	testutils/Makefile. 
	* testutils/configure.ac: Fixed typo.


2007-06-21  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* bsd/sccs.c: Updated the copyright text to be consistent with the
	COPYING.bsd file (by removing the advertising clause).

	* sccsfile.cc (print_subsituted_flags_list): Return true if
	nothing failed (as opposed to falling off the end of the
	function).   This prevents spurious x-file write errors if the y
	flag is unset.

	* cssc.h: Require exception support to compile.  This is not
	strictly necessary for successful operation, but without exception
	support "get s.foo s.bar" will not process s.bar if we failed on
	s.foo.  So exception support is required for full SCCS
	compatibility.

2007-06-20  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* bsd/sccs.c (unedit): Fix "sccs unedit /tmp/SCCS/s.foo will
	cause ./s.foo to be unlinked" bug, by forming the g-file name
	from the p-file name, as opposed to the name of the file on the
	command line (because the file named on the command line gould be
	either the g-file or the s-file).
	* docs/BUGS: Mention the bugfix.
	* tests/bsd-sccs/delsfile.sh: New test, for this bug.

	* .gitignore: Ignore Emacs editor backups.

	* cap.cc, val.cc: Add explicit template instantiation directives to
	support compilation with GCC's -fno-implicit-templates option.
	* dtbl-prepend.cc, fileiter.cc, sccs-delta.cc: ditto
	* sccsfile.cc: Ditto.  Also include "mylist.h" to get the method
	definitions for the templates.

	* .gitignore, docs/.gitignore, testutils/.gitignore: New files.

	* tests/common/test-common: Work around an apparent bug in Bash
	3.1.17(1) in which "$@$ac_c" expands to DEL${ac_c} when $1 is "".
	That broke echo_nonl, causing some tests to fail.

	Tolerate leading spaces in the counts of inserted/deleted/unchanged lines in the delta table; System III seems to produce/tolerate these (see Neil Mayhew's bug report regarding a pre-1985 file)

2005-06-18  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* file.cc, filelock.h, quit.cc, quit.h:
	Applied Sourceforge patch 1223116, allowing CSSC to be compiled on Darwin.  Darwin's version of GCC doesn't like #pragma implementation.

2005-04-06  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* docs/Platforms: CSSC now builds under GCC-3.4.

	* sccsdiff.sh.in:
	Fixed SourceForge bug 966010, sccs sccsdiff -r cannot have space
	before revision number.   We still will have similar problems
	elsewhere in the suite, I suspect.

	* sf-prs.cc, sf-delta.cc:
	Fixed SourceForge bug 1045768: CSSC does not compile with gcc 3.4

2004-10-16  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>
