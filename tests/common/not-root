# The test suite fails if run by root, because when you are root,
# "test -w foo" returns 0 even for read-only files because root can
# write to them.
#
# The test suite depends on being able to accurately detect a readonly file.

# Execute in a subshell so that we can use "trap ... 0" and 
# ensure that the temporary file is removed before we reach 
# the end of this file.
