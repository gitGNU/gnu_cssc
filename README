This is the README file for GNU CSSC, a workalike for the source code
control system SCCS.  It is based on the MySC package by Ross Ridge.

CSSC is currently under development so expect problems with compiling
the package on older machines and perhaps even incorrect operation.
For a list of known bugs see docs/BUGS.  For a list of now-fixed bugs
see docs/FIXED.
==============================================================================
			Quick Start
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Compiling
 mkdir work
 cd work
 ../configure
 make

2.	Testing 
 if make check 2>&1 | tee make.log 
 then
	uname -a | mail -s "CSSC success" jay@gnu.org
 else
	echo FAILED, please send full details to 'jay@gnu.org.'
	(uname -a ; cat make.log) | mail -s "CSSC failure" jay@gnu.org 
 fi


 If the tests failed, I'll definitely need some more information and
 so it would be best to keep the test outputs in case I need them in
 order to fix the bug ("tar cf failed-tests.tar tests" should do fine
 for that).  I may need to ask you to send a comressed version of this
 to me.


3.	Installing
 cd work
 make install

==============================================================================

SCCS commands implemented this package are: admin, cdc, delta, get,
prs, prt, sccsdiff, rmdel, sact, unget and what.  Not all options and
capabilities of the commands have been implemented yet, and the comb,
val and vc commands are not provided at all.  Features soon to be
provided but not yet available are the BSD sccs-driver command "sccs",
and a Bourne shell script for converting SCCS files to RCS files (a
csh script exists for this purpose [sccs2rcs.csh] but not everybody
has csh).

The utilities use traditional getopt-like command-line argument
parsing which differs from how the standard SCCS commands parse
commands-line arguments.  The key difference is that command line
options that take arguments can be specified with or without a space
(eg.  "-r1.3" or "-r 1.3").  A side effect of this is that if an
option that can take argument, it must take an argument.  Where
supplying an empty argument for an option of a standard SCCS command
is meaningful, the corresponding command provides an additional option
that does not take any arguments and has the same option letter but in
upper case (eg. use "delta -Y" instead of "delta -y").

	* Please note that this is currently being *
	* worked on and so if you discover that    *
	* some option has the wrong behaviour,	   *
	* please report it as a bug.               *

Unimplemented features include support for binary files, consistency
checking (admin -h), ignored deltas (delta -g), printing the
differences after a delta (delta -p), l-files (get -l), and getting a
delta by sequence number (get -a).  Some features like including and
excluding deltas (get -i -x) have been implemented but not extensively
tested.

See the file INSTALL for information on how to compile this package.
Send any questions or bug reports by e-mail to the current maintainer,
<jay@gnu.org>.  After you have compiled CSSC, _PLEASE_ run the test
suite, as described in docs/TESTING.
