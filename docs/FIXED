List of fixed bugs 


Naturally there are many CSSC bugs that have been fixed but are not
listed here.  Bugs are only listed here if they have ever been listed
in the BUGS file.  Bugs that are discovered by the maintainers and
which are fixed before the next release are also probably not listed
(even if the big ones are mentioned in the NEWS file).  This doesn't
mean that the unmentioned bug is not in any released version; it may
have been present in all previous versions, there just wasn't a
release made while this bug was KNOWN.  The ``real'' criterion is, if
it's easier to just fix the bug than list it in BUGS _and_ I do it
promptly, it does not get listed.  If you don't like this (lack of?)
policy, let me know.  All bugfixes are listed in ChangeLog, in some
fashion.

./get -r2 -e s.foo doesn't create a new release, it just gets the most
recent delta on the trunk, if release 2 doesn't exist.

Sun May  4 18:03:20 1997: (fixed in version 1.4 of sf-get.cc)
Selection of the correct SID to get is still wrong in get.  For
example if you specify -r1 you should get the last 1.x release, but
you don't.

 CSSC's "admin" adds users to the SCCS in the reverse order
 compared to SCCS.

In version 0.03-pl2.  Unfixed.
 If you create an SCCS file using "-i" from a file with (say)
 500000 lines, real SCCS does it, but puts "99999" in the 
 summary line for that delta.  Currently, CSSC puts the "correct"
 number of lines, and then fails when reading the file back in
 for some other purpose, giving the error "Number too big".
 The correct behaviour would be to follow what SCCS does.
