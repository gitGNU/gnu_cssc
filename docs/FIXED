List of fixed bugs 

Sun May  4 13:12:57 1997:
./get -r2 -e s.foo doesn't create a new release, it just gets the most
recent delta on the trunk, if release 2 doesn't exist.

Sun May  4 18:03:20 1997: (fixed in version 1.4 of sf-get.cc)
Selection of the correct SID to get is still wrong in get.  For
example if you specify -r1 you should get the last 1.x release, but
you don't.
