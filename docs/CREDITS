The MySC package provides the bulk of the functionality of this
package, compiled under GCC 2.4.5, and was written by Ross Ridge.

This package was updated for modern C++ compilers, fixed, enhanced,
made more portable and sparingly documented by James Youngman,
<jay@gnu.org>.

Lars Hecking <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie> provided valuable help with
Autoconf and portability information for Solaris, SunOS, AmigaOS, and
IRIX.  Plus, lots and *lots* of testing and useful bug reports.


Dave Bodenstab <imdave@mcs.net> is to be thanked for providing patches
for FreeBSD-2.0.5 support -- these were largely to fix silly
assumptions (location of "true", GCC-2.6.3 support), nothing catering
to FreeBSD especially.

Malcolm Boff <Malcolm_Boff@compuserve.com> provided a useful bug
report for FreeBSD (apparently "echo -e -n" is invalid; the options
are exclusive).


Support for development snapshots of GCC (as of 1997-08-11) was
contributed by Fila Kolodny <fila@ibi.com>.
