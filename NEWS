New in CSSC-0.03alpha-pl1

        * Changed the version number format again.  It's the last
	  time, I promise.  Probably.

	* Works with versions of "make" other than GNU make, thanks to
	  GNU automake.  In particular, it's been tested with BSD
	  make.

	* Now works (again) on systems lacking strstr(), rename(), or
	  remove().

New in CSSC-devel-0.03a-pl0

	* Fundamental changes, hence new version number.

	* Major change is switch to using "automake" to generate the
	  "Makefile.in" files.  The consequent changes may break
	  things for some machines.

	* The test suite now has its own chapter in the manual.

New in CSSC-0.02-devel-pl7

	* The test scripts now correctly test the %P% keyword.

	* The test scripts now avoid using "echo -n -e" since 
	  the two options are incompatible on (some versions of?)
	  FreeBSD.

New in CSSC-0.02-devel-pl6

	* The -m and -n options of get had been the wrong way around.
          This is now fixed.

	* Fixed "what": the marker '@(#)' is no longer printed.

	* Added documentation for prs.

	* Fixes to get (keywords %I% %R% %L% %B% %S%, plus 
	  correct subsitution when the "-c" option is used).

New in CSSC-0.02-devel-pl5	

	* FreeBSD support (+ SMP build as a side effect, probably)

	* Support for G++ 2.6.3 (as well as 2.7.x)

	* Relocatable info directory.
