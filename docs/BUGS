List of known bugs (bugs are moved to FIXED as they are fixed so it is
valid but unlikely for there to be nothing below this line)

 CSSC's "admin" adds users to the SCCS in the reverse order
 compared to SCCS.

Mon Nov 17 18:01:05 1997: Richard Polton <rap@maths.soton.ac.uk>
In version 0.03-pl2.  Unfixed.
 If you create an SCCS file using "-i" from a file with (say)
 500000 lines, real SCCS does it, but puts "99999" in the 
 summary line for that delta.  Currently, CSSC puts the "correct"
 number of lines, and then fails when reading the file back in
 for some other purpose, giving the error "Number too big".
 The correct behaviour would be to follow what SCCS does.


Wed Nov  5 18:56:06 1997: James Youngman <jay@gnu.org>
In version 0.02-pl6.  Unfixed.
 GCC version 2.7.2.2 compiled for an Alpha running NetBSD fails to
 compile delta.cc.  If falls over with an "Unrecognised insn" error.


Tue Jul 22 08:07:29 1997: Lars Hecking <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>
In version 0.02-pl3.  Unfixed.
 Irix 6.3, gcc-2.7.2.2 configured for Irix 5.3 (32bit-64bit issue):
  All tests passed except for test-admin. test-admin fails in
 init-mr.sh:
laredo (53) sh ./init-mr.sh 
I1...passed 
I2...passed 
I3...passed 
I4...passed 
I5...passed 
I6...1c1
< 2.1
---
> 1.1
FAIL init-mr.sh I6: stderr format error with ../../get -p s.new.txt

This indicates that the -r option of "admin -i" has failed to produce
an initial SID od 2.1, but has instead produced the default, 1.1.
Examination of the SCCS file bears this out:-

begin 644 s.new.txt

On systems with no working fork() or spawn(), we have to use system()
to execute commands.  The return value of system() is
implementation-defined unless its argument is NULL.  Hence we cannot
place any interpretation on the return value.  This means that we will
be unaware of any return value from the command and (for example) MR
validation will not happen reliably.
