On systems with no working fork() or spawn(), we have to use system()
to execute commands.  The return value of system() is
implementation-defined unless its argument is NULL.  Hence we cannot
place any interpretation on the return value.  This means that we will
be unaware of any return value from the command and (for example) MR
validation will not happen reliably.
