New in CSSC-0.08alpha-pl0

	* The program now works on systems with no <string> header file.
	  Previously existing support for this situation had a bug that
	  resulted in CSSC being unable to open files named filenames
	  containing more than one slash.  Apologies to Achim Hoffmann
	  for this bug.

	* Using "-" as a command line argument now works correctly
	  again; a list of files to process is read from stdin.

	* "prs -r" with no argument for the -r now works correctly,
           rather than failing.

	* Work correctly even when invoked with one or more of the 
	  standard file descriptors closed (rather than corrupting an
          output file).

	* Preliminary support for continuing to process the argument list
          even if one of the files named early on the command line fails.
	  This support is incomplete, though the current situation is better
	  than before.  There may be a few cases where the program
	  eventually exits with the wrong error level.  There may even
	  be cases where the program now continues when it should not.

	* Corrected RPM spec file.
	
	* Added COPYING.bsd and sccs.1 to the distribution.

	* Ensure the test suite is not run by root (because 
	  "test -w" gives misleading results for root).
	
New in CSSC-0.07alpha-pl2
	
	* Bugfixes for Sun Code Manager compatibility.

New in CSSC-0.07alpha-pl1

	* get: eliminated spurious warning about keyword expansion and
	  binary files.

	* delta: Allow backslashes to escape newlines when entering
	  comments, MRs, etc.

	* "sccs create": pass the -b flag to admin, but not to get.

	* Small correction to test suite entry for prt.

New in CSSC-0.07alpha-pl0

	* "get -e" should now (again) re-use deltas that have been
           removed with rmdel.

	* Tests for sccs(1) in the test suite.
	
	* Modifications to string handling (fixes for possible bugs)
          in sccs(1).

	* sccs(1) should now compile on Linux under libc version 5 
          (as well as libc version 6, under which it already did 
          compile).

	* Added options --cssc, --prefix, --version and -V to sccs(1)
          and documented them in its manual page.
	
New in CSSC-0.06alpha-pl8
	
	* Fixed some compilation warnings.

	* Fixed the formatting of MR numbers in prt.

New in CSSC-0.06alpha-pl7

	* Fixed bug with ignored deltas that manifested when 
	  working with SCCS files produced by Sun's "Code
	  Manager" product.

New in CSSC-0.06alpha-pl6

	* Included the BSD sccs.c program for the first time.
          It has not been tested.  It's work-in-progress.

	* The "-t" option of the "get" command is now implemented. 

New in CSSC-0.06alpha-pl5

	* Bugfix for rmdel; it now no longer corrupts the SCCS file
  	  it operates on (previously all the delta control lines had
	  been stripped out).
	
New in CSSC-0.06alpha-pl4
	
	* admin's -n and -i options now work correctly with absolute
	  pathnames.

	* Fixes for support of SCCS files whose names contain a space.

New in CSSC-0.06alpha-pl3

	* "admin -i" now works when the input file turns out 
          to need encoding.  We do not need to be able to seek 
	  on the input file, so stdin from a pipe works fine,
	  even if the -b option is not given.  We also have tests for
	  this situation.

New in CSSC-0.06alpha-pl2

	* 8-bit input data now works, as ordinary text.  This means that
	  you can use use CSSC to control revisions of ISO-8859 text
          files without needing to encode them (i.e. using the -b flag
	  of admin).  SCCS also supports this.
	
New in CSSC-0.06alpha-pl1
	
	* "get" keywords now sustitute the right values, the ones
	  corresponding to the delta actually being gotten, not the 
	  ones corresponding to the delta that last modified the line 
	  currently being worked on.

	* Bugfixes; "get s.foo -Gbar" is now equivalent to 
	  "get -Gbar s.foo".  This fix applies to all the programs,
	  not just "get".


New in CSSC-0.06alpha-pl0

	* Binary file support (with test suite support).

New in CSSC-0.05alpha-pl1

	* When root runs "get -e", we used to get a "target file
	  is writable" error even if the gotten file is NOT writable.  
	  This has been fixed.

	* Binary-file support has been worked on.  It does not 
          work reliably for large files.   PLEASE DON'T USE IT AT
	  ALL.   The problem lies in pipe.{cc,h}.  Work progresses.
	  Some test cases live in tests/binary.

	* Added a spec-file for RPM in the "auxfiles" directory.
	  See http://www.rpm.org/ for further information.

	* When get ignores the "-b" flag, the user is warned.

	* "get -e -r1.1.1" now works (previously this produced an	
	  assertion failure).

	* Added manual section explaining when and how branches are
	  made.

New in CSSC-0.05alpha-pl0

        * cdc has now been debugged using new test cases.  
	
	* The sact, cdc, rmdel and prt commands have now been
	  documented in the manual.

	* sccsdiff has been improved by Richard Polton
	  <rap@scopic.com>, (the code was rewritten by myself).

	* Initial support for extremely long (>99999 line) files.
	  Also, test scripts for these.

	* Small bugs relating to exact emulation of "real" SCCS 
	  fixed in admin (-a and -e simultaneously of the same user 
	  now does the right thing, and -a adds users in the right 
	  order).
	
	* Significant code reorganisation


New in CSSC-0.04alpha-pl0

	* Fixes for year-2000 compliance.  While previous versions
	  did in fact work in the year 2000, version 0.04 includes
	  fixes for bugs with the years 2019, 2020, and also a 
	  partial fix for the Unix year-2038 problem.  SCCS files
	  containing dates throughout the valid range for SCCS
	  (1969-2038) work correctly.  "delta", "cdc" and "admin -i"
	  Depend on the operating system function time(), and so
	  may stop working on some systems in the year 2038.  Y2k
	  compliance tests have been added to the testsuite.  

	* A chapter on Year 2000 issues has been added to the manual.

	* We no longer need to have a mktime() function.

	* We now use the standard C++ <string> header, if available.

New in CSSC-0.03alpha-pl2

	* Really fixed the test case for %P% in tests/get this time.

	* Indicated that GNU make and /bin/posix/sh are required on 
	  HP-UX version 9.

New in CSSC-0.03alpha-pl1

        * Changed the version number format again.  It's the last
	  time, I promise.  Probably.

	* Works with versions of "make" other than GNU make, thanks to
	  GNU automake.  In particular, it's been tested with BSD
	  make.

	* Now works (again) on systems lacking strstr(), rename(), or
	  remove().

New in CSSC-devel-0.03a-pl0

	* Fundamental changes, hence new version number.

	* Major change is switch to using "automake" to generate the
	  "Makefile.in" files.  The consequent changes may break
	  things for some machines.

	* The test suite now has its own chapter in the manual.

New in CSSC-0.02-devel-pl7

	* The test scripts now correctly test the %P% keyword.

	* The test scripts now avoid using "echo -n -e" since 
	  the two options are incompatible on (some versions of?)
	  FreeBSD.

New in CSSC-0.02-devel-pl6

	* The -m and -n options of get had been the wrong way around.
          This is now fixed.

	* Fixed "what": the marker '@(#)' is no longer printed.

	* Added documentation for prs.

	* Fixes to get (keywords %I% %R% %L% %B% %S%, plus 
	  correct subsitution when the "-c" option is used).

New in CSSC-0.02-devel-pl5	

	* FreeBSD support (+ SMP build as a side effect, probably)

	* Support for G++ 2.6.3 (as well as 2.7.x)

	* Relocatable info directory.
