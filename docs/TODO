	* Find out if SCO's "unget" produces any output.  We currently
	  output a SID but it looks like SCO's does not.

	* also, tests/prt/all-512.txt suffers from the fact that 
	  SCO does not have "prt"!    No idea if it exists
	  but lives in a funny place, etc.

	* Find out if genuine SCCS works when the s-file's name
	  contains a space.  Find out particularly if the right
	  thing happens when delta invokes diff.

	* tests: Testing for binary files: 
	OK, check that "prs -d:GB:", "prs -d:BD:" and "prt -b" work OK.  
	Also check zero-length files, keyword substitution, large
	binary files.

	* admin: check that the # of lines inserted is correct for the
	first delta.

1998-01-25  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* bodyio.cc: Test what happens if the text input ends with
	  "%A", that is, the peeked character is EOF.  At the moment,
	  we ungetc(EOF); is that valid?

	* bodyio.cc: Test for sane behaviour if we get a disk-full
	  condition while writing the body part of an SCCS file
	  with admin -i.   Especially important for text files;
	  we probably want to avoid retrying with binary encoding.

	* Make sure get is 8-bit clean for "ASCII" files containing 
	  ASCII NUL; make sure admin generates a binary file if this
	  appears in the input.

1998-01-11  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* Write documentation for sccsdiff in cssc.texi

Wed Nov 12 00:00:44 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* Write test cases for admin's -h, -l, -r, -V, and -z
 	flags.

	* Write test cases for delta's -g, -n, -p, -r, -s flags.

	* Write test cases for get's -i, -l, -lp flags.

	* Write code and test cases for "sccs", val and sccs-comb.

	* Write documentation and test cases for sccsdiff.

Mon Aug  4 23:33:16 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Check that Dave Bodenstab's changes also provide for running the
 	test suite under SunOS, as I suspect -- because all that was
 	required was the ability to select a shell other than /bin/sh.
	

Wed Jul  9 18:22:56 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Migrate from <cstdio> to <iostream> (any nay-sayers?)

Sat Jun 28 12:25:12 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Allow the utilities to be built with a shared library containing
 	at least $(SFILE_OBJS) and $(COMMON_OBJS).  May have to provide
 	two version numbers, one for the library and one for each app.  I
 	don't expect to need/want to support user code linking against the
 	library, the intent is just to conserve disk space and perhaps
 	system memory too.

Fri Jun 27 19:40:22 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Make sure we can make a branch at a null delta after making it.

Mon May 26 14:56:52 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Write tests for comb, rmdel, sact, sccsdiff, val.

Sun May 25 16:27:05 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Complete the test cases in admin/flags.sh.

Sat May  3 11:45:19 1997  James Youngman  <james@bugalugs.no.where>

	* Check the interaction between any -r option to get and the
	release floors and ceilings.

	* Use standard string class rather than mystring?

	* sf-admin.cc: Test setting & removing the 'e' flag. (is it allowed?)

	* Write a shell script for converting SCCS files to RCS files; use
	the Bourne shell, since not everybody has the C shell [suggested
	by RMS].

	* Consider using the BSD sccs(1) code.

	* sccs-val is not yet provided.   Useful for testing.
