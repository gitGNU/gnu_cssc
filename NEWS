	* When get ignores the "-b" flag, the user is warned.

	* "get -e -r1.1.1" now works (previously this produced an	
	  assertion failure).

	* Added manual section explaining when and how branches are
	  made.

        * cdc has now beed debugged using new test cases.  
	
	* The sact, cdc, rmdel and prt commands have now been
	  documented in the manual.

	* sccsdiff has been improved by Richard Polton
	  <rap@scopic.com>, (the code was rewritten my myself).

	* Initial support for extremely long (>99999 line) files.
	  Also, test scripts for these.

	* Small bugs relating to exact emulation of "real" SCCS 
	  fixed in admin (-a and -e simultaneously of the same user 
	  now does the right thing, and -a adds users in the right 
	  order).
	
	* Significant code reorganisation


New in CSSC-0.04alpha-pl0

	* Fixes for year-2000 compliance.  While previous versions
	  did in fact work in the year 2000, version 0.04 includes
	  fixes for bugs with the years 2019, 2020, and also a 
	  partial fix for the Unix year-2038 problem.  SCCS files
	  containing dates throughout the valid range for SCCS
	  (1969-2038) work correctly.  "delta", "cdc" and "admin -i"
	  Depend on the operating system function time(), and so
	  may stop working on some systems in the year 2038.  Y2k
	  compliance tests have been added to the testsuite.  

	* A chapter on Year 2000 issues has been added to the manual.

	* We no longer need to have a mktime() function.

	* We now use the standard C++ <string> header, if available.

New in CSSC-0.03alpha-pl2

	* Really fixed the test case for %P% in tests/get this time.

	* Indicated that GNU make and /bin/posix/sh are required on 
	  HP-UX version 9.

New in CSSC-0.03alpha-pl1

        * Changed the version number format again.  It's the last
	  time, I promise.  Probably.

	* Works with versions of "make" other than GNU make, thanks to
	  GNU automake.  In particular, it's been tested with BSD
	  make.

	* Now works (again) on systems lacking strstr(), rename(), or
	  remove().

New in CSSC-devel-0.03a-pl0

	* Fundamental changes, hence new version number.

	* Major change is switch to using "automake" to generate the
	  "Makefile.in" files.  The consequent changes may break
	  things for some machines.

	* The test suite now has its own chapter in the manual.

New in CSSC-0.02-devel-pl7

	* The test scripts now correctly test the %P% keyword.

	* The test scripts now avoid using "echo -n -e" since 
	  the two options are incompatible on (some versions of?)
	  FreeBSD.

New in CSSC-0.02-devel-pl6

	* The -m and -n options of get had been the wrong way around.
          This is now fixed.

	* Fixed "what": the marker '@(#)' is no longer printed.

	* Added documentation for prs.

	* Fixes to get (keywords %I% %R% %L% %B% %S%, plus 
	  correct subsitution when the "-c" option is used).

New in CSSC-0.02-devel-pl5	

	* FreeBSD support (+ SMP build as a side effect, probably)

	* Support for G++ 2.6.3 (as well as 2.7.x)

	* Relocatable info directory.
