	* Write documentation for sccsdiff in cssc.texi

Wed Nov 12 00:00:44 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* Write test cases for admin's -h, -l, -r, -V, and -z
 	flags.

	* Write code and test cases for admin's -b flag.

	* Write test cases for delta's -g, -n, -p, -r, -s flags.

	* Write test cases for get's -i, -l, -lp flags.

	* Write code and test cases for "sccs", val and sccs-comb.

	* Write test cases for cdc.

	* Write documentation and test cases for sccsdiff.

	* Check that Dave Bodenstab's changes also provide for running the
 	test suite under SunOS, as I suspect -- because all that was
 	required was the ability to select a shell other than /bin/sh.

	* Migrate from <cstdio> to <iostream> (any nay-sayers?)

Sat Jun 28 12:25:12 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Allow the utilities to be built with a shared library containing
 	at least $(SFILE_OBJS) and $(COMMON_OBJS).  May have to provide
 	two version numbers, one for the library and one for each app.  I
 	don't expect to need/want to support user code linking against the
 	library, the intent is just to conserve disk space and perhaps
 	system memory too.

Fri Jun 27 19:40:22 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Make sure we can make a branch at a null delta after making it.

Mon May 26 14:56:52 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Write tests for cdc, comb, rmdel, sact, sccsdiff, val.

Sun May 25 16:27:05 1997  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Complete the test cases in admin/flags.sh.

Sat May  3 11:45:19 1997  James Youngman  <james@bugalugs.no.where>

	* Check the interaction between any -r option to get and the
	release floors and ceilings.

	* Use standard string class rather than mystring?

	* sccsfile.h: get, delta and sccs-diff must use the "encoding" flag.

	* sf-admin.cc: Test setting & removing the 'e' flag. (is it allowed?)

	* Write a shell script for converting SCCS files to RCS files; use
	the Bourne shell, since not everybody has the C shell [suggested
	by RMS].

	* Consider using the BSD sccs(1) code.

	* sccs-val is not yet provided.   Useful for testing.
