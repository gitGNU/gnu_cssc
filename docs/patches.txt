If you are kind enough to submit patches, first of all, thanks.
Second, it makes life much easier for me if you submit unified diffs
("diff -u") and if all diff'ed paths are relative to the top-level
directory.  I also have a preference for diffs split by type (that is,
diffs for the test suites, code diffs for foo, code diffs for bar, and
so on).  This makes applying your patches a lot easier -- but as I
said above, first and foremost thanks for contributing!

When submitting diffs, please indicate what they are for (that is,
please indicate the nature of the bug they fix or the system and
version which requires the change).

One last thing; if your editor makes backup files as you work, please
delete these backups before computing the diff, particularly if you
use "diff -r".

You can submit patches by email to bug-cssc@gnu.org.  However, if they
are large, we may need you to assign copyright in those changes to the
Free Software Foundation before applying them.
