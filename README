This is the README file for the package CSSC, a workalike for the
source code control system SCCS.  It is based on the MySC package by
Ross Ridge.

CSSC is currently under development so expect problems with compiling
the package on older machines and perhaps even incorrect operation.
For a list of known bugs see docs/BUGS.  For a list of now-fixed bugs
see docs/FIXED.

SCCS commands implemented this package are: admin, cdc, delta, get,
prs, rmdel, sact, unget and what.  Not all options and capabilities of
the commands have been implemented yet, and the comb, val and vc
commands are not provided at all.  Features soon to be provided but
not yet available are the BSD sccs-driver command "sccs", and a Bourne
shell script for converting SCCS files to RCS files (a csh script
exists for this purpose [sccs2rcs.csh] but not everybody has csh).

The utilities use traditional getopt-like command-line argument
parsing which differs from how the standard SCCS commands parse
commands-line arguments.  The key difference is that command line
options that take arguments can be specified with or without a space
(eg.  "-r1.3" or "-r 1.3").  A side effect of this is that if an
option that can take argument, it must take an argument.  Where
supplying an empty argument for an option of a standard SCCS command
is meaningful, the corresponding command provides an additional option
that does not take any arguments and has the same option letter but in
upper case (eg. use "delta -Y" instead of "delta -y").  Please note
that this is currently being worked on and so if you discover that
some option has the wrong behaviour, please report it as a bug.

Unimplemented features include support for binary files, the null
delta flag (admin -fn), consistency checking (admin -h), ignored
deltas (delta -g), printing the differences after a delta (delta -p),
l-files (get -l), getting the most recent delta of a release (get -t),
and getting a delta by sequence number (get -a).  Some features like
including and excluding deltas (get -i -x) have been implemented but
not extensively tested.

See the file INSTALL for information on how to compile this package.
